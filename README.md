#  JoltPhysics

This repository provides a precompiled **JoltPhysics** (built with the Distribution configuration) library packaged as an **XCFramework** for **macOS**, **iOS**, **tvOS**, and **visionOS**.  
It enables easy integration of the high-performance **Jolt Physics Engine** into native Apple platform projects, including those built with Swift, Objective-C, or C++. Other platforms like Windows, Linux, Android, WASM are expected to be also included in the future when [Binary Static Library Dependencies](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0482-swiftpm-static-library-binary-target-non-apple-platforms.md) will be implemented.

## About JoltPhysics

[JoltPhysics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) is an open-source C++ physics engine designed for games and real-time applications.  
It features multithreaded simulation, determinism, and broad collision support - while maintaining exceptional performance and scalability.

This package includes a port of JoltPhysics compiled for Apple platforms, distributed as an `.xcframework` for straightforward integration.

## Features

- Built for **Apple Silicon** and **Intel** (macOS)
- Supports **iOS**, **macOS**, **tvOS**, and **visionOS**
- Includes **device** and **simulator** slices
- Distributed as an **XCFramework** via Swift Package Manager
- Compatible with **C++17** and higher
- Ready for integration into Swift or C++ projects


## Integration

You can add this package directly to your Xcode project:

1. In Xcode, open **File -> Add Packages...**
2. Enter the package URL: 
```plain
https://github.com/EvgenijLutz/JoltPhysics.git
```

Currently, only C++ is the way to access this library's API, due to project's `#include` conventions. You can include Jolt headers in your C++ code as follows:

```cpp
// Generated by cmake - include them before including Jolt headers.
#define NDEBUG
#define JPH_OBJECT_STREAM

// The Jolt headers don't include Jolt.h. Always include Jolt.h before including any other Jolt header.
#include <Jolt/Jolt.h>

// Now you can include any other Jolt headers
// #include <Jolt/RegisterTypes.h>
// #include <Jolt/Core/Factory.h>
// and so on...
```
